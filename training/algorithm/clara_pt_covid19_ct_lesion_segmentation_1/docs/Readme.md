# Disclaimer
This training and inference pipeline was developed by NVIDIA. It is based on a segmentation and classification model developed by NVIDIA researchers in conjunction with the NIH.

# Model Overview
A pre-trained model for volumetric (3D) segmentation of the COVID-19 lesion from CT images.

## Workflow
The model is trained using a 3D SegResNet [1].

## Data
This model was trained on a global dataset with a large experimental cohort collected from across the globe. The CT volumes of 919 independent subjects are provided by NIH with expertsâ€™ lesion region annotations.

- Target: Lesion
- Task: Segmentation
- Modality: CT
- Size: 919 3D volumes (736 Training, 90 Validation, 93 Testing)
- Challenge: Large ranging foreground size

# Training configuration
The training was performed with the following:

- Script: train_multi_gpu.sh
- GPU: four (at least) 16GB of GPU memory
- Actual Model Input: 224 x 224 x 32
- AMP: False
- Optimizer: Adam
- Learning Rate: 1e-3
- Loss: DiceCELoss

**If out-of-memory or program crash occurs while caching the data set, please change the ``cache_rate`` in ``CacheDataset`` to a lower value in the range (0, 1).**

## Input
Input: 1 channel CT image with intensity in HU and arbitary spacing

1. Resampling spacing to (0.8, 0.8, 5) mm;
2. Clipping intensity to [-1000, 500] HU;
3. Converting to channel first;
4. Randomly cropping the volume to a fixed size (224, 224, 32);
5. Randomly applying spatial flipping;
6. Randomly applying spatial rotation;
6. Randomly shifting intensity of the volume.

## Output
Output: 2 channels
- Label 0: background
- Label 1: lesion

# Model Performance
Dice score is used for evaluating the performance of the model. On the test set, the trained model achieved score of 0.7109 for lesion.

## Training Performance
Training loss over 2000 epochs.

# Intended Use
The model needs to be used with NVIDIA hardware and software. For hardware, the model can run on any NVIDIA GPU with memory greater than 16 GB. For software, this model is usable only as part of Transfer Learning & Annotation Tools in Clara Train SDK container.
